The model is predicting all sells because it's learning the dominant pattern in your data rather than being selective about reversal points. 
I need to add several key improvements:

1- Post-processing logic to suppress non-reversal predictions
2- Threshold-based filtering using probability confidence
3- Temporal consistency checks (reversals should be sparse)
4- Better training strategy focusing on precision over recall
        
Perfect! I've made critical improvements to ensure realistic reversal predictions:
Key Changes:
1. Adjusted Sample Weights (Training)

	- Class 0 (no signal): weight = 0.1 (de-emphasized)
	- Class 1 & 2 (reversals): weight = 10.0 (heavily emphasized)
	- This teaches the model that reversals are rare but important

2. Post-Processing Filters (Prediction)

Added two intelligent filtering functions:
* apply_reversal_filters():

	- Confidence threshold: Only accepts reversals with 65%+ probability
	- Relative strength check: Reversal probability must be 1.5x stronger than no-signal probability
	- Max signals limit: Allows maximum 2 reversal signals per 10-hour window
	- Sorts by confidence: Keeps only the most confident reversal predictions

* temporal_consistency_check():

	- Prevents contradictory signals (buy immediately followed by sell)
	- Removes the weaker of two conflicting signals

3. Output Enhancement

	- Shows raw predictions (before filtering) for transparency
	- Shows filtered predictions (the final output)
	- Displays specific reversal signal details with timestamps and confidence

4. Lower Learning Rate

Reduced from 0.001 to 0.0005 for more stable convergence
