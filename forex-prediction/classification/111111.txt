Please think long and hard.
I am building a Forex time-series classification model in Python/Jupyter.
The goal is to detect trend-reversal points using 130,000 hours of labeled historical H1 data.
--------------------------
Goal
--------------------------
The dataset contains a "Label" column with trend-reversal classes:
0, 1, and 2.
The model should learn patterns that indicate reversal points and reproduce this labeling on unseen data.
Given 120 consecutive unseen hourly candles, the model must predict trend reversal points (0, 1, 2) for the next 5 hours immediately following the 120th candle.
Classes: 0=no signal, 1=buy reversal, 2=sell reversal

--------------------------
Additional information:
--------------------------
The label distribution in df_model is highly imbalanced:
    - Class 0 ≈ 98.55%
    - Class 1 ≈ 0.73%
    - Class 2 ≈ 0.73%

--------------------------
My request:
--------------------------
I have written the following code.
Please review my code and identify the single most important problem, then suggest how to fix it.
