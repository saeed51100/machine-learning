Please think long and hard.
I am developing a time-series classification pipeline in Python (Jupyter Notebook) to identify Forex price trend regimes based on historical price data.
The dataset consists of approximately 170,000 rows of Forex OHLCV data on the H1 (hourly) timeframe, with the following characteristics:
* Dataset Description
    1- The main DataFrame df contains 140,000 rows and 10 columns:
        DATETIME, DATE, TIME, OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, TICKVOL, VOL, SPREAD.
    2- Each row represents one hour of Forex price data.
    3- The dataset is fully continuous; all weekend and holiday gaps have already been forward-filled.
    4- The DATETIME column is strictly chronological and represents the true time index.

I have written code that adds a Label column to df_model to represent the dominant price trend:
    1 → Bullish trend
    2 → Bearish trend

The current code works correctly and assigns labels 1 and 2 as intended.

* Question
I now want to extend the existing logic to also label flat (sideways) market conditions:
0 → No meaningful trend (sideways / flat movement)

Please update my code so that:
    - The existing logic for labeling 1 (bullish) and 2 (bearish) remains unchanged.
    - The new label 0 is added only for flat trend conditions.
