Please think long and hard.
I am developing a time-series classification pipeline in Python (Jupyter Notebook) to identify Forex price trend regimes based on historical price data.
The dataset consists of approximately 170,000 rows of Forex OHLCV data on the H1 (hourly) timeframe, with the following characteristics:
* Dataset Description
    1- The main DataFrame df contains 140,000 rows and 10 columns:
        DATETIME, DATE, TIME, OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, TICKVOL, VOL, SPREAD.
    2- Each row represents one hour of Forex price data.
    3- The dataset is fully continuous; all weekend and holiday gaps have already been forward-filled.
    4- The DATETIME column is strictly chronological and represents the true time index.
    5- The dataset contains a 'CLOSE' price column and a corresponding 'Label' column that indicates price trend events with three classes:
        0 → No meaningful trend (sideways / flat movement)
        1 → Bullish trend
        2 → Bearish trend

* Goal
    The model should learn patterns that indicate price trend and reproduce labeling on unseen data.

* Question
My program uses the following three important parameters, the correct setting of which has a direct impact on the performance of the model:
1- WINDOW_SIZE = : Number of unseen candles input to the model
2- FORECAST_HORIZON = : Size of the forecast horizon
3- TREND_SIZE = Duration and magnitude of a trend ( For example, about a few hours )
What is the common value of the above parameters to get good results?
