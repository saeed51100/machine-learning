I have written a machine learning program in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and I would like guidance on best practices to improve its design, structure, and performance.
I will share the important parts of the code along with a high-level summary. The program also generates several reports, and I would like your advice on which reports are the most useful to share for effective feedback.

* Program Overview
    This is a time-series classification program trained on historical Forex data to predict price trend reversal points.

* Program Components
    1- Create df_model from the raw DataFrame and add the Label column
    2- Chronological data splitting
    3- Data scaling
    4- Sequence generation (WINDOW_SIZE → X, FORECAST_HORIZON → y)
    5- Class imbalance handling (class-weighted loss)
    6- Model building, training, and evaluation

* Reports Generated by the Program
    1- Evaluation on the test set
    2- Training history
    3- Full training history exported as JSON
    4- Training loss plot (PNG)
    5- Accuracy plot (PNG)
    6- Confusion matrix

* Code Summary
Approximately 300 lines of Python/Jupyter code

* Main Question
Given the size of the codebase and the number of generated reports, I am unsure how to present this information effectively so that you can provide the most accurate and actionable recommendations.
Sharing everything at once may lead to information overload or confusion. Therefore, I would like a recommended roadmap or order for sharing:

    - Code sections
    - Training artifacts
    - Evaluation reports

so that you can review the program systematically and suggest meaningful improvements.
