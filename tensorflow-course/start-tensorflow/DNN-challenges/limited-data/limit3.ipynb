    "## What is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset is adapted for a new but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, you \"transfer\" the learned knowledge from one task to another."

    "1- Pre-trained Model: A model is trained on a large dataset (e.g., financial time series, stock market, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Feature Extraction: The lower layers of the model extract general features (e.g., patterns in price movements).\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Fine-Tuning: The last few layers are retrained (or replaced) with new data specific to your problem."

    "## How Can You Use Transfer Learning in Forex Prediction?\n",
    "Since Forex prediction is a time-series problem, transfer learning is less common than in image or NLP tasks, but you can still apply it in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Use Pre-Trained Financial Models\n",
    "Instead of training an LSTM/Transformer model from scratch, you can use pre-trained models on financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using a stock market prediction model and fine-tuning it on Forex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Use Pre-Trained Deep Learning Models for Feature Extraction\n",
    "You can use deep learning models (like LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers) trained on general time-series data and adapt them for Forex prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A model trained on stock data might learn price trend patterns that are also useful in Forex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Leverage Pre-Trained Models for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "If you want to incorporate news sentiment analysis into your Forex model, you can use BERT or GPT-based models trained on financial news to extract insights."
